# My Server Status
My Server Status is a mobile application developed with Flutter that shows the user realtime information about a server's hardware.

This application gets the information from an external API. You must deploy the API to your server to use this application. Check [this repository](https://github.com/JGeek00/my-server-status-api) to learn more.
